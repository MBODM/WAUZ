# WAUZ
A tiny unzip tool for World of Warcraft addons

![WAUZ](screenshot.png)

### What it is
It´s a very simple and tiny .NET 6 application named WAUZ (**W**orld of Warcraft **A**ddons **U**n**Z**ip).

It´s used to unzip a bunch of downloaded zip files, residing in some folder, into another folder (in this case the zip files are addons for the popular [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com) MMORPG game).

It´s sole purpose is to just extract zip files into a folder. Nothing else. It´s just there to make your life a little bit easier.

### How it works
- Download a bunch of World of Warcraft addons (typically from https://www.curseforge.com) into some temporary download folder.
- Start WAUZ
- Select the folder which contains the downloaded addon zip files (Source-Folder). Typically some temporary download folder.
- Select the folder to unzip the addons into (Destination-Folder). Typically the World of Warcraft AddOns folder.
- Press the "Unzip" button.
- Hint: Bookmark all the direct download sites, for every addon, in your browser. Especially for https://www.curseforge.com you can bookmark an addon´s download site directly. The addon download immediately starts, after clicking the bookmark. This helps a lot to get all the latest addon versions very fast, without much effort, and you quickly have all of them in a single folder. The process of manually unzipping them all is way more time consuming. But that´s the moment when WAUZ comes to rescue. :wink:
- Hint: WAUZ will never remove, overwrite or touch any other files or folders in the Destination-Folder, besides the files and folders that will be unzipped from the zip files.
- Hint: WAUZ will save your folder settings automatically, when you close the app.

### Why it exists
I developed a download manager for World of Warcraft addons, called [WADM](https://github.com/mbodm/wadm), over a decade ago. For many many years WADM handled all of my addon updating needs with ease. But since Curse/Overwolf changed their political stance, alternative download managers (like WADM, Ajour, WowUp, or others) no longer works with the https://www.curseforge.com site, or their REST web service. The only option is to use their own addon download manager. Many of us don´t want that, for different reasons.

So, downloading the addons manually (which is not the time consuming bottleneck here) and unzipping them, with the help of a tool like WAUZ, is still not the worst alternative to a full featured download manager. For more information about the "end of all alternative addon download managers" follow the links on my above mentioned WADM GitHub site, or use your GoogleFu.

### Requirements

- 64-bit Windows

There are not any other special requirements. All the release builds are compiled with *win-x64* as target platform, assuming you are using some 64-bit Windows (and that's quite likely).

You can choose between self-contained and framework-dependent .NET application builds, when downloading a release. You can find more information about that topic on the [Releases](https://github.com/mbodm/wauz/releases) page.

WAUZ is just a typical ".exe" file Windows application. Just download the newest release, unzip and run it. That´s it. No installer, setup or something like that.

### Notes
- WAUZ saves your selected folders in a settings file when you close the app.
- WAUZ writes a log file if some error happens.
- You can find both files in the "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\MBODM" folder.
- WAUZ uses a timeout of 30 seconds, while unzipping the zip files.
- WAUZ unzips the files in parallel.
- WAUZ is written in C# and developed with .NET 6, in Visual Studio 2022.
- WAUZ is using Windows.Forms as GUI framework.
- I never compiled WAUZ with other tools, like Rider or VS Code. I solely used Visual Studio 2022 Community.
- If you wanna compile the source by your own, you just need Visual Studio 2022 (any edition). Nothing else.
- The release-binaries are compiled as _self-contained_ and _framework-dependent_ .NET 6 .exe files, with "win-x64" as target.
- The code is using the TAP pattern of .NET, including concurrency concepts like `async/await` and `IProgress<>`.
- The code is using a typical `CancellationToken` timeout pattern.
- WAUZ is under MIT license. Feel free to use the source and do whatever you want. I assume no liability.
- WAUZ just exists, because i am lazy and made my life a bit easier, by writing this tool. :grin:

#### Have fun.
